# Section 2
title2 = "2. README.md"
body2 = "A comprehensive README.md file is included at the root of the repository. It successfully covers the required setup instructions (including the 'google-genai' dependency and API keys), instructions on how to run both the main application and the unit tests, a complete example of input and output, and the assumptions made regarding model routing and SDK error handling."

# Section 3
title3 = "3. A short demo"
body3 = "A fully self-contained demo is implemented within 'main.py'. By running the script directly, it automatically provides a sample vulnerable Python snippet (containing OS command injection and weak MD5 hashing) and a natural language query to the AI agent. The resulting structured output is clearly printed to the terminal. The exact code snippet and resulting output are also permanently documented within the README.md file."
